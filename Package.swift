        Set `strict-concurrency` to `targeted` to enforce Sendable and actor-isolation
        checks in your code. This explicitly verifies that `Sendable` constraints are
        met when you mark one of your types as `Sendable`.

        This mode is essentially a bit of a hybrid between the behavior that's intended
        in Swift 6, and the default in Swift 5.7. Use this mode to have a bit of
        checking on your code that uses Swift concurrency without too many warnings
        and / or errors in your current codebase.

        Set `strict-concurrency` to `complete` to get the full suite of concurrency
        constraints, essentially as they will work in Swift 6.
